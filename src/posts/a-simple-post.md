This year I've decided to review the once-a-year treat that is the mince pie. There's plenty of choice&nbsp;and this year and I've been piling on the Christmas pounds for your mince pie happiness. Here's the low down.

## Supermarkets

**Asda**\
Shortcrust: 5/10 - This from the extra special range had a great filling but was let down by a under baked pastry. Unforgivable.

**Iceland**\
Shortcrust: 7/10 - After going viral with their 'Minge Pie' typeface issues, these dinky pies are a bargain at £1.50 for 12. Surprisingly they are well baked and the mince is tasty with a pleasant nutty crunch.

**Sainsbury**\
Shortcrust: 9/10 - Really nice mince to pastry ratio, and the mince itself is probably the best I've tasted.
Puff Pastry: 6.5/10 - Brilliant mince pie, however I think they have slightly over done it with the pastry, minus points for the&nbsp;flaky mess.

**Morrisons**\
Shortcrust: 6/10 - Not a bad attempt, let down by the tasteless mince meat.
Puff Pastry: 4/10 - This didn't put me in the festive mood at all, too dry.

**Tesco**\
Shortcrust: 7/10 - Lovely mince pie, pastry cooked really well, mince good but not excellent.
Puff Pastry: 8/10 - Tesco have nailed the puff pastry on this one, it would have received a really high score had the mince been up to Sainsbury standard.

**Costco**\
Shortcrust-cake: 5/10 - This won't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with Costco, but these are 3x the size of your standard. Call me a traditionalist but I'm not sure if these even&nbsp;meet the 'pie' brief since they have a mince/cake filling, sorry but it's a little wrong if you ask me.

**Aldi**\
Shortcrust: 6/10 - I've been a huge advocate of Aldi and in past years I remember their mince pies being extremely good, however I was&nbsp;disappointed with this years offering. Pastry fine, mince ok. A little sugar on top and some booze in the mince would've gone a long way.

**Lidl**\
Shortcrust/Crumble: 7/10 Full marks for inventiveness, the crumble topping is inspired and certainly brings something new to the party. Quite a hefty pie borderline too big, but it is Christmas after all.

## Bakery

**Martins**
Shortcrust: 8.5/10 - For a chain bakers such as Martins these pies look surprisingly homemade, not the prettiest but don't let the exterior fool you, they are fantastic.

**Greggs**\
0/0 - The branch I visited&nbsp;didn't even bake&nbsp;mince pies, tut tut tut.

## Branded

**Mr Kipling**
Shortcrust: 5/10 - The most worrying thing about these pies is how long they last (best before the middle of 2015!)

## Chains

**Pret a Manger**
Shortcrust: 6/10 - At the pricier end of the market, £1.30 per pie isn't what you'd call cheap but they are deep and well filled. The mince wasn't to my taste it's a little stodgy and doesn't really pack any punch. It could have been luck&nbsp;but mine was still warm which definitely adds a couple of points.

**Starbucks**\
Shortcrust: 5/10 -&nbsp;Even pricier than Pret at £1.55 but just as disappointing probably more so. The mince had a nice texture but it wasn't matched in taste, pastry was nothing a bog standard Mr Kipling couldn't manage.

So there you have it, my roundup for 2014. Have you stumbled upon a glorious mince pie? I'd love to hear your thoughts [tweet me @ricriley](https://twitter.com/ricriley)
